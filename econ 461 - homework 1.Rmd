```{r}
library(fpp2)
help(gold)
help(woolyrnq)
help(gas)
```

```{r}
#Question 1. Use the help function to explore what the series gold, woolyrnq and gas represent. 

#a. Use autoplot() to plot each of these in separate plots.

autoplot(gold)
is.ts(gold)
```

```{r}
autoplot(woolyrnq)
is.ts(woolyrnq)
```

```{r}
autoplot(gas)
is.ts(gas)
```

```{r}
#Question 1: Use the help function to explore what the series gold, woolyrnq and gas represent. 

#b. What is the frequency of each series? Hint: apply the frequency() function.

frequency(gold)
```

```{r}
frequency(woolyrnq)
```

```{r}
frequency(gas)
```

```{r}
#Answers: 
# 1, 4, 12 (respectively)
```

```{r}
#Question 1. Use the help function to explore what the series gold, woolyrnq and gas represent.

#c. Use which.max() to spot the outlier in the gold series. Which observation was it?

which.max(gold)
gold

#Answer:
# The 770th observation is the outlier.
```

```{r}
#Question 2: Download the file tute1.csv from the book website, open it in Excel (or some other spreadsheet application), and review its contents. You should find four columns of information. Columns B through D each contain a quarterly series, labelled Sales, AdBudget and GDP. Sales contains the quarterly sales for a small company over the period 1981-2005. AdBudget is the advertising budget and GDP is the gross domestic product. All series have been adjusted for inflation.

#a. You can read the data into R with the following script:
tute1 <- read.csv("tute1.csv", header=TRUE)
tute1
```

```{r}
#b. Convert the data to time series
mytimeseries <- ts(tute1[,-1], start=1981, frequency=4)

#Note: (The [,-1] removes the first column which contains the quarters as we donâ€™t need them now.)
```

```{r}
#c. Construct time series plots of each of the three series

autoplot(mytimeseries, facets=TRUE)
autoplot(mytimeseries)

#Note: when you don't include facets=TRUE, the plots are not colored and it is separated into 3 different parts. In each data set, there might be more than 1 data so we want to read them in separate plots. If not, sometimes graphs may overlap which makes it confusing to observe.
```

```{r}
#Question 4: Create time plots of the following time series: bicoal, chicken, dole, usdeaths, lynx, goog, writing, fancy, a10, h02.

#Use help() to find out about the data in each series.
#For the goog plot, modify the axis labels and title.

help(bicoal)
bicoal
autoplot(bicoal)
```

```{r}
help(chicken)
chicken
autoplot(chicken)
```

```{r}
help(dole)
dole
autoplot(dole)
```

```{r}
help(usdeaths)
usdeaths
autoplot(usdeaths)
```

```{r}
help(lynx)
lynx
autoplot(lynx)
```

```{r}
help(goog)
goog
autoplot(goog) + 
  ggtitle("Daily closing stock prices of Google Inc") +
  xlab("Consecutive Trading Days (between 25 February 2013 and 13 February 2017)") +
  ylab("Closing Stock Prices")

#Note: do not need to load in ggplot
```

```{r}

```{r}

fancy
autoplot(fancy)

```{r}
